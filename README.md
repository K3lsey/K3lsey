## Hiiii, My name is Kelsey Cole; I am a junior in high school, and my pronouns are she/her!
- I was born and raised in Texas, but I spent a considerable amount of my life in New Orleans, Louisiana.
- In my free time, I enjoy playing video games; as of right now, I am playing Baldurs Gate 3, FarCry 3, Overwatch, Fortnite, Dead by Daylight, and Rainbow 6 Siege.
- A (somewhat) fun fact about myself is that I have four other siblings!
- Currently, my favorite class is art!
- Lastly, I really **REALLY** love Arcane! ^_^
